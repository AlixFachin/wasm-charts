# Principle ðŸ’¡

This is a small project enabling me to dabble into WebAssembly

## The idea ðŸ¤”

The idea is to generate a random chart, and sort it with a C++ routine (called through WebAssembly)

## Resources ðŸ“š

- I used [emscripten](https://emscripten.org) to compile C++ code into WASM
- I followed (closely!) the tutorial made by Marco Selvatici at <https://marcoselvatici.github.io/WASM_tutorial/>
- I used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) to bundle the code
